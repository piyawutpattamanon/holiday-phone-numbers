Test Problem #2 Phone Number Extraction

extract distinct phone numbers from HTML files

Assumptions :
- HTML files stored in one directory (and its sub directories) called "test-html"
- each HTML file is small so that reading its entire content into memory at one time is possible
-- this way works faster (and take me less time to code) than to code streaming
- the phone number formats we want to extract now are only 2 commonly used formats we see in online communities in Thailand, 08x xxx xxxx and 02 xxx xxxx without extensions and region code.
- not use any HTML parser at this time though.
- currently not use distributed programming or any native language to boost the performance further, balancing between time-to-code and performance

To Run :
ruby main.rb
