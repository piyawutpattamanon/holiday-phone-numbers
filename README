Test Problem #2 Phone Number Extractions

Assumptions :
- HTML files stored in one directory (and its sub directories) called "test-html"
- each HTML file is small so that reading its content all into memory at one time is possible
-- its works faster (and take me less time to code) than code streaming
- the phone number formats we want to extract now are only 2 commonly used formats we see in online communities in Thailand, 08x xxx xxxx and 02 xxx xxxx without extensions and region code.

To Run :
ruby main.rb
